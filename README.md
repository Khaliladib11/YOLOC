# YOLOC: You Only Look Once for City.

*City* because the main objective of the model is to help autounoumous cars to navigate inside the city, moreover, this is a part of my master thesis at [City University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/).

This work is based on a model called **YOLOP: You Only Look Once for Panoptic Perception**.
